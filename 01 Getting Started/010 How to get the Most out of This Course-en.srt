1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,030
So let's get started with that course.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,200
But first I want to explain you how you can get the most out of this course.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,950
Obviously you watch the videos and I highly recommend that you all to code along right.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,260
Decode yourself.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,640
This is how you learn the most.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,110
Additionally check my source code.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:27,170
If you are encountering issues you can find it attached to the end of each module and also to a lot

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:34,170
of lectures for all the module and I do provide the source code because sometimes it's just a tiny typo

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,770
and if you don't run my source code and compare it to yours you won't be able to find out what's wrong

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,360
in your code and get a deeper understanding of why it went wrong.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,640
Also consider D many hints and things.

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,970
I will teach you in the debugging section of this course.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,560
There I will teach you how to handle re-act errors and how to react to them and fix them.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,470
Definitely something you have to know how to do.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,460
So use that knowledge you gain there to fix any issues you encounter.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,070
Now if you're stuck and you can't find error ask in the Q and A section.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,940
My team and I are more than happy to help you there but that's important.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,500
Don't just ask there.

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,360
Also answered there.

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,970
I'm not saying this because I don't want to answer your questions.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,220
I will but if you answer you'll learn way more than if you ask.

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,740
Asking is so simple but answering is hard.

23
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,580
And you can't go wrong there.

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,850
Even if your answer is wrong no one is going to kill you.

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:39,380
Instead you're going to learn if people correct you and answering forces you to think about a problem

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,820
and find a solution.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,630
If you really want to become a great re-act developer you have to solve problems and answering the Q

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:55,150
and A section is a good way of practicing just that and finally practice practice practice.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,540
It's as easy as that.

30
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,390
Even after you've finished this course you've got to practice the things you've learned.

31
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:07,850
You have to build your own demo projects set your own challenges Dudi exercises from this course alter

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,630
the code you'll learn in this course practice react.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,900
If you follow these steps and follow through this entire course you'll be an awesome re-act developer

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,410
and you'll be able to apply for chops.

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,850
Become a re-act freelancer whatever you want with dad.

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,520
Let's dive into react and learn how it works.
