1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,460
So we already got our hands dirty and we saw how we Bulgar react.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,620
Now does all the answers about why we might want to use react.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,730
There's also more.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:20,760
There are more reasons why we want to use re-act react helps us with a problem will encounter with normal

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,900
javascript DUI state becomes difficult to manage in bigger javascript applications.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,520
You have to manually target elements in your dom and if you don't change the structure of your age Jammal

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,470
code chances are you need to change the way you target your elements because you used Cuore selector.

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,610
Or even if you used Shakeri traversing the dorm is easier but it's still always something you have to

9
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,590
keep in mind.

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,020
And if you got more complex web apps where you dynamically add and remove elements this quickly can

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,640
become cumbersome in our courts project we bowled AB which is highly dynamic where we are able to build

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
a burger and dynamically add or remove ingredients.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,040
If you write this with normal javascript code it's going to be a nightmare.

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,370
So re-act helps us by making the whole UI state management a non issue.

15
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,440
It allows us to focus on our business logic instead of keeping our application from exploding.

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,400
And additionally re-act is maintained by a big community.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,510
So chances are the react code is written better than we could have ever written it.

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,480
So therefore it's highly efficient and fast.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,850
And the bigger your application gets the more this matters too.

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,370
And finally re-act features a huge eco system and an extremely active community which means that there

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,210
is a great chance that for a given problem you face you'll find a solution or an extra packet you can

22
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,770
add to fix it.

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,960
All these are reasons why re-act is awesome and why you definitely should consider it for your next

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,440
project and why you made the right choice to start with this course.
