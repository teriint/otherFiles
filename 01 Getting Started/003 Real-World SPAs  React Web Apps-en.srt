00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,470
So in the last lecture I explained Ted reactor's all about components and that components are awesome.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,760
That's actually Cedar's on a real web page here's react.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,280
J.S. dot org which is the official web page.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,030
Or do you react to them.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,550
And if we have a look at it it is actually built with re-act of course.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,530
This looks like a normal web page and it is of course but we can split this up into components.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,380
We've got this hattery component in there we get these single navigation item components.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:42,030
We got this starting image call to action components here and we got all our elements here down here

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,860
where they advertise react and what it is about we see more components year like DS emerge code snippet

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,040
components year with some descriptions to the left of it.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,400
All these things are basically building blocks which we can of course easily consider as reusable pieces

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,880
and actually are reusing this aliments year.

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,890
We got one element here and then the same element with different content being used below it.

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,810
Now of course you can hard code all that with just H-G mail javascript and C-s else but then you will

15
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,050
have to repeat your code over and over again here with components you build your own h m l elements

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,970
so to say and then you just reuse that element.

17
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,560
And behind the scenes does H Tim L element has all this content already inside of it and we'll see this

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,680
in detail in a second.

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,080
And that's a good example would be you would have me here on the page where I searched for the UK as

20
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,130
an alternative to react.

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,880
There we see we get a lot of components too.

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,830
We got that whole hador with the search bar component.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,580
Then we got the search result summary component here where it also allows us to filter the search results

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,290
and then the search results themselves.

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,540
We got really used list item components here.

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,060
Each of them has an image and a different title.

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,680
But in the core they all are the same.

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390
They all have the same structure.

29
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:13,440
And you do me also uses a javascript framework to achieve this and to have an easier time developing.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
And that's important.

31
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,820
Maintaining and updating this page.

32
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,970
So does why components are awesome and why we as a developer probably want to use components and that

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,680
is why we act is all about components.
