1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,020
Not it's not just react.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,330
There are also alternatives re-act of course is what we'll cover in this course.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,350
But there also is Engler and there would be viewed chaos and there are avarice like backbone or amber

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,730
but angular and view are the most popular alternatives.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,330
And I can only recommend diving into DS to to really pick your favorite.

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,250
I also got courses on them if you are interested.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,500
All three of them are great at creating highly scalable web applications that look and feel good to

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,090
the user.

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:41,050
Not so much an alternative as Jake where he you might think it is one but Shakeri is really only about

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,820
traversing the dorm and targeting elements in a dorm.

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,490
Now as you saw in our example re-act is about just declaring what you see and focusing on the logic

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,050
instead on focusing on the how and therefore react angular and view allow you to create more powerful

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,860
applications because you can focus on the logic and your business model and not so much on the technical

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,450
side of actually reaching dead element.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,670
You wanted to change.
