Welcome to discourse about react it's great to have you on board.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,920
My name is on Schwartz Molla and I'm a freelance web developer.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,500
Andrew yeck developer I worked with re-act a lot and I can tell you it's an amazing library for creating

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:24,360
highly reactive and super fast javascript driven web applications the javascript driven part is especially

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,020
important because since Riak is a javascript library it's of course about writing your web apps in javascript

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,250
and that in turn is amazing because since javascript runs in the browser it allows you to create superfast

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,880
web apps that feel like mobile apps.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,190
Users don't have to wait for Peytral loads.

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:51,060
Now re-act is probably the most popular javascript library you can learn these days.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,940
And for a good reason you will learn all of its core features from this course and way more than that

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,960
you will learn what reactor's about how it works and why you might want to use it.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,620
You will learn how to build components would react how to use read X for better state management how

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,450
to use d react router and you'll not just learned as simple projects or theory.

14
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,230
No we will build an entire re-act application throughout this course.

15
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,360
The Bergere Boulder which is an amazing application utilizing all the concepts you learn in this course

16
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,410
so that you have a really solid understanding of all the concepts taught throughout this course.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,450
By the end of the Course you'll therefore have way more than just a solid understanding of react and

18
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:43,230
you'll be able to dive deeper into more challenging projects and apply for reactive Alper chops or become

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,370
a Riak developer.

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,250
As a freelancer Whatever your goal is.
